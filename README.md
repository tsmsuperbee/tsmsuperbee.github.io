## 🐱 How To Play + Instructions: 
Necessary keyboard keys/controls will after starting a new game. After completing the game, the time taken for completion will be shown to you. 
- Use W,A,S,D or Arrow Keys to move
- Hold SHIFT to run
- Use J to open the journal
- Use SPACE to interact with items or speak to others

## 🐱 Summarized Mechanics: 
The player explores areas to discover the setting and gain information about the setting and it's inhabitants (like Meowpheus!)
The information that the player encounters (quests, dialog, clues etc.) is recorded in an always accesible and frequently updated journal.
The player will use their skills and knowledge (along with the journal, if they need it!) to form a pertinent word by walking on letter tiles scattered across special dream-like maps (SOS, state of stupor) all while dodging projectiles that reset their progress.
